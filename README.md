## Instruction

1. Install latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't have it already installed.
2. Copy the repository or fork it.
3. Open terminal in the folder with the project and install dependencies .

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. There are already installed all dependencies that you will need to solve the tasks.
6. There is also Tailwindcss installed if you would like to style your elements with it.
7. All the files related to given tasks should be within folders that are already created for those tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 1

- Add logic for adding new posts to the list. The user should be able to provide the title and content of the post.
- The component should display the list of posts in a card format. Each card should display the title and content of the post.
- You can use the code from the demo.

### Task 2

- Create logic for two counters. Each counter has an input field where user can provide a number to increase the counter by that number.
- Counter 1: Whenever user increases the counter, the value should update on the screen.
- Counter 2: Whenever user increases the counter, the value should not update on the screen until next rerender, no matter how many times user increased it.

### Task 3

- Create custom hook named however you like, which will handle the logic of the form.
- The form has 4 fields: username, email, password, and confirm password.
- There should be no data stored outside of that custom hook.
- The form should have a submit button to log the data in the console.
- The form should have a rest button for resetting the data.

#### Bonus style points:

- Password match validation.
- Email format validation.
